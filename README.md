I'm currently developing a real-time task management MERN project. The backend utilizes Joi for validation and boasts clean code, with authentication already implemented and APIs developed. On the frontend, I'm using React alongside Redux and have made significant progress with the Socket.io documentation. I aim to complete the project as soon as possible.
